# pokeweb

Frontend for pokemart, a mock E-commerce web app. 

Built with [next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and stylized with [chakra-ui](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui).

[formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik) is used so that pages that require user input are easier to manage.

[urql](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql) is used for the graphql client with types/hooks of queries generated from [graphql-code-generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator).
